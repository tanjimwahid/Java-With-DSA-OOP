# Java With OOP & DSA Master Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Java programs and Data Structures & Algorithms implementations. It covers a wide range of core concepts, problem-solving techniques, and advanced data structures, aiming to provide a strong foundation and hands-on coding practice.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Java Programming Fundamentals
- Basics of Programming, Flowcharts & Pseudocode
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Conditional Statements & Loops
- Functions, Scope & Pass-by-Value
- Arrays & 2D Arrays
- Strings & StringBuilder
- Pattern Problems

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors, Getters/Setters
- Static Members & Function Overloading
- Inheritance, Encapsulation & Abstraction
- Polymorphism, Abstract Classes & Interfaces

### 🔹 Problem Solving & Algorithms
- Time & Space Complexity Analysis
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Divide & Conquer Techniques
- Bit Manipulation
- Greedy Algorithms

### 🔹 Data Structures
- Arrays & ArrayLists
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks & Queues (Array & Linked List Based)
- Heaps & Priority Queues
- HashMaps & HashSets
- Tries

### 🔹 Advanced Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (Tabulation & Memoization)
- Knapsack, LCS, Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Graphs (DFS, BFS, MSTs, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, etc.)
- Segment Trees (Range Queries)
- Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees (Traversals, LCA, Balanced Trees)

## 🛠️ Structure
The repository is organized into multiple folders:
- `JavaBasics/` – All fundamental concepts and examples.
- `OOP/` – Object-oriented programming in depth.
- `DSA/` – Core and advanced data structures.
- `Algorithms/` – Recursion, backtracking, sorting, etc.
- `Graphs/`, `Trees/`, `DP/`, `Tries/`, `Heaps/`, etc. – Specialized algorithm topics.

## ✅ Progress
This repository is actively being updated. Future additions will include:
- GUI Projects (Java Swing/JavaFX)
- File I/O handling & Serialization
- Mini Projects using Java
